# Plans

- Keep code as component-driven as possible
  - Use functions for creating rows of the table, etc.
- use some functional programming to assist in deletion
  - this is mostly practical because there's no pre-existing stuff to attach event listeners to
- strictly use `addEventListener` and `document.createElement`
